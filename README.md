# Hi, I’m Divine 👋

I’m a blue team–focused SOC Analyst and Incident Responder. Most days you’ll find me monitoring environments, digging into suspicious activity, and moving quickly when something looks real.

I work across the full alert lifecycle: triage, log correlation, threat hunting, and writing clear incident notes that help teams make decisions fast. I’m comfortable working in messy situations, staying calm under pressure, and adding structure when things get noisy. My goal is always the same: understand what happened, stop it, and leave the environment more secure than before.

## What I do
- Alert triage and investigation (end-to-end)
- Log correlation across endpoint, network, identity, and cloud sources
- Threat hunting and hypothesis-driven analysis
- Detection engineering and tuning (reducing noise, improving coverage)
- Incident response support (containment, eradication, recovery)
- Malware and basic forensics support
- Automation and scripting to speed up response and make it repeatable

## Tools and tech
**SIEM:** Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel  
**EDR/XDR:** Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (and similar EDR workflows)  
**Cloud security:** Azure / Microsoft security stack (Sentinel + Defender), cloud log sources  
**IR & analysis:** MITRE ATT&CK mapping, timeline building, IOC handling, case documentation  
**Scripting & queries:** Python, SQL, KQL, SPL  
**General:** Windows, Linux, TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP/S, identity and authentication logs
