# Hi, I’m Divine 👋

I’m a **Blue Team-focused SOC Analyst and Incident Responder**. Most days, you’ll find me deep in the logs, digging into suspicious activity, and moving fast when an alert turns out to be the real deal.

I live across the full incident lifecycle—from the first "hit" in the SIEM to the final post-mortem. I’m at my best when things get messy; I enjoy staying calm under pressure, cutting through the noise, and adding structure to a chaotic investigation. My goal is always the same: **figure out exactly what happened, stop it, and make sure the environment is harder to hit next time.**

### 🛠️ What I Do
*   **End-to-End Investigation:** Taking an alert from initial triage through deep-dive correlation.
*   **Log Correlation:** Connecting the dots across endpoint, network, identity, and cloud sources.
*   **Threat Hunting:** Building hypotheses to find the "quiet" threats that automated tools might miss.
*   **Detection Engineering:** Tuning rules to kill the noise and improve actual detection coverage.
*   **Incident Response:** Supporting the full cycle of containment, eradication, and recovery.
*   **Forensics & Malware:** Providing baseline analysis and building out detailed attack timelines.
*   **Automation:** Scripting the repetitive stuff so the team can focus on the hard problems.
